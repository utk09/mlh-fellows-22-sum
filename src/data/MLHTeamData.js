      "I would say grasping the data model consideration of Solana is the hardest part. By the end of the fellowship I felt our pod had a great handle on what to consider when archeticting a solana app. From simple things as what should be used as a pda, to how to more complexs structures and security checks such as authority models in Solana programs. \n\nI'd encourage any of the student to go out and build their own ideas for onchain apps now! Take what you learned and apply it to anything you think would be cool to work on. I'm sure you'll run into some snags along the way but if you just come back this project as an example I don't think it'll take any of you too long to get passed them and thats whats most important.",
